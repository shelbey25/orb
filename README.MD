# ORB Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project initialized with Tailwind CSS and Prisma.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Project Structure

- `src/pages`: Next.js Pages Router
- `src/components`: React components
- `src/styles`: Tailwind global styles
- `prisma`: Database schema

## Notes

- **Vite vs Next.js**: You mentioned Vite in your request. Next.js uses its own high-performance bundler (based on Webpack/Turbopack) which serves the same purpose as Vite for development and building. The command `npm run dev` will start the fast development server.
